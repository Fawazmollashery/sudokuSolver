Number Guessing Game - React + Vite



This is a simple and beautiful Number Guessing Game built with React and Vite. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is "too low" or "too high," and it tracks how many tries the player took to guess correctly.

Features

ðŸŽ¯ Random Number Generation: The app generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of the game.
ðŸ“ˆ Feedback: After each guess, the app provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high.
ðŸ“Š Track Tries: The app tracks how many guesses (tries) the player makes.
ðŸ”„ Play Again: After guessing the correct number, the player can click "Play Again" to reset the game and try again.
Tech Stack
React: For building the UI components and handling the logic.
Vite: As the build tool and development server, providing a fast development experience.
CSS: Custom styling for a clean and modern UI.

Game Flow
Random Number Generation: At the start, the app generates a random number between 1 and 100. This number is stored in the component's state.
User Input: The player inputs a number and clicks the "Submit Guess" button.
Feedback:
If the guessed number is lower than the target, the app displays "ðŸ“‰ Too low! Try again."
If the guessed number is higher than the target, the app displays "ðŸ“ˆ Too high! Try again."
If the guess is correct, the app displays "ðŸŽ‰ Correct!" and shows the number of tries the player took.
Play Again: After guessing the correct number, the player can reset the game by clicking the "Play Again" button, which reloads the page.
